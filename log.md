# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 January 2019
Did some FCC Introduction to JavaScript items and worked some more on fixing the styling of my Personal Portfolio Webpage from the Responsive Web Design Challenges - passed tech tests previously, but styling is still in progress. 

### Day 2: 15 January
Did another 15 FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges. Would've been more but I spent a LOOOOOOOONG time trying to complete https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/word-blanks/. Not gonna lie: YouTube helped, but I get it now. Hindsight... right?

### Day 3: 16 January
Started reading up on SQL and doing basic SQL exercises. Also coded the outline of my new site. Finally, a few more FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges.

### Day 4: 17 January
A spot of light reading on Python. Annnnnnd, just for a change, some more FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges (my brain hurts!).

### Day 5: 18 January
Went back to the beginning of the FCC JavaScript challenges and started them again. Repetition and reinforcement is the goal. Also watching (and attempting) JS tutorials on YouTube. Finally, reading @YDKJS (https://twitter.com/YDKJS) Up & Going

### Day 6: 19 January
Watched the first lecture of #CS50: Introduction to Computer Science and played in GitHub. Tinkered with VS Code too trying out different HTML and CSS options.

(Playing around with Github Desktop:)
TEST: Updated locally via Github Desktop to check out how it works.
RESULT: Pushed up, and it synced perfectly. 
TEST: Changing online version.
RESULT: Fetched via Desktop Client and All is well.
Success.

May have posted a bit early... Been a busy day! In addition to the above I installed and got the hang of GitHub Desktop, read up on Docker, general Linux stuff, the command line, and even tried out @codewars and @hackerrank (these are great!).

### Day 7: 20 January
Lots of @SoloLearn.  Lots and lots! HTML, CSS and SQL.

### Day 8: 21 January
Still busy redoing the @freeCodeCamp Intro to JavaScript challenges to ensure I completely understand them. Also completed the HTML Fundamentals course on @SoloLearn (which threw some JS in there too to keep me on my toes.)

### Day 9: 22 January
Worked on some more FCC Intro to JavaScript challenges. Finished the first half that I recently decided to redo from scratch and got to tackle a few brand new ones too.

### Day 10: 23 January
Used some of my new-found coding knowledge to make some big layout changes to our (non-tech) company's websites. Nice to be able to do these things myself now instead of asking others. I only have access to change the HTML, but hey, it's a start.

### Day 11: 24 January
Watched part of @cs50 Week 1 lecture on @edXOnline, where C programming is introduced.

### Day 12: 25 January
Continued with #CS50 Week 1 lecture, and tried my hand at CS50 Sandbox, including the first task.

### Day 13: 26 January
Finished the #CS50 Week 1 lecture. Busy Saturday, so not much time for any more than that today.

### Day 14: 27 January
Got cracking with the JavaScript Tutorial on @SoloLearn.

### Day 15: 28 January
Completed a fair bit more of the JavaScript Tutorial on SoloLearn.

### Day 16: 29 January
Started learning about JavaScript objects.

### Day --: 30 January
SKIPPED

### Day 17: 31 January
Completed approx half of the SoloLearn CSS course.

### Day 18: 1 February
Did lots more of the SoloLearn CSS course. Approx 75% of the way through. It's great for refreshing the knowledge gained in the CSS section of freeCodeCamp's RWB certification. It also adds a few new items too, which is always welcome.

### Day 19: 2 February
Finished the @Sololearn CSS Fundamentals course. Side quest complete. 
Back to learning JavaScript then!

### Day 20: 3 February
Picked up where I'd left off on Sololearn's JavaScript tutorial - Objects, Methods, Arrays.

### Day 21: 4 February
Continued working on Sololearn's JavaScript tutorial - more Objects plus some DOM lessons.

### Day 22: 5 February


### Day 23: 6 February
