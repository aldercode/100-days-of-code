# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 January 2019
Did some FCC Introduction to JavaScript items and worked some more on fixing the styling of my Personal Portfolio Webpage from the Responsive Web Design Challenges - passed tech tests previously, but styling is still in progress. 

### Day 2: 15 January
Did another 15 FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges. Would've been more but I spent a LOOOOOOOONG time trying to complete https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/word-blanks/. Not gonna lie: YouTube helped, but I get it now. Hindsight... right?

### Day 3: 16 January
Started reading up on SQL and doing basic SQL exercises. Also coded the outline of my new site. Finally, a few more FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges.

### Day 4: 17 January
A spot of light reading on Python. Annnnnnd, just for a change, some more FCC Introduction to JavaScript challenges (my brain hurts!).

### Day 5: 18 January
Went back to the beginning of the FCC JavaScript challenges and started them again. Repetition and reinforcement is the goal. Also watching (and attempting) JS tutorials on YouTube. Finally, reading @YDKJS (https://twitter.com/YDKJS) Up & Going
